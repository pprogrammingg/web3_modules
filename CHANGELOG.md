## 2025-01-29

- **Consensus comparison table (BFT vs PoS)**: Verified and corrected the comparison table in Module 1.2 (Consensus Basics).
  - **PoS communication**: Updated from "O(1) per block" to "Often O(n) among validators (when BFT-style)" to match real PoS designs (e.g. Ethereum 2.0, Tendermint).
  - **PoS fault tolerance**: Clarified from "Up to 50% stake" to "Honest majority of stake (<50% adversarial)" for accuracy.
  - **BFT fault tolerance**: Clarified as "Up to f of 3f+1 Byzantine (≤1/3)".
  - **Finality (PoS)**: Refined to "Probabilistic or economic; often requires time."
  - **Context**: Added short intro comparing classic BFT (fixed set) vs open PoS (stake-weighted), and a **Proof of Work (PoW)** paragraph so PoW is included in the comparison.
- **Docs**: Added CHANGELOG.md and clarified in README how to build and open the project (no `scripts/build-data.js`; open `index.html` or use a local server).
