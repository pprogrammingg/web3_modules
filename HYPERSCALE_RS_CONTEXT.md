# Creating Hyperscale-rs Specific Modules

When creating modules specific to the hyperscale-rs codebase, provide:

## Option 1: GitHub Link (Easiest)
Just give me the GitHub URL:
```
https://github.com/flightofthefox/hyperscale-rs
```

I can:
- Read the repo structure
- Access guides in `/guides`
- Understand crate organization
- Reference specific files

## Option 2: Specific File Links
For targeted modules, link to specific files:
```
https://github.com/flightofthefox/hyperscale-rs/blob/main/crates/bft/src/state.rs
```

## Option 3: Local Reference
If you have the repo locally, you can:
1. Point me to the workspace path
2. I'll read files directly
3. Create modules based on actual code

## What I Need

To create a hyperscale-rs module, tell me:

1. **Module topic** (e.g., "BFT Implementation Deep Dive")
2. **Repo location** (GitHub URL or local path)
3. **Specific focus** (e.g., "block proposal flow in crates/bft/src/state.rs")
4. **Difficulty level** (Basic/Intermediate/Advanced)

## Example Request

```
Create a module on "BFT Consensus Implementation" for hyperscale-rs.
Repo: https://github.com/flightofthefox/hyperscale-rs
Focus on: crates/bft/src/state.rs and crates/bft/src/vote_set.rs
Difficulty: Intermediate
```

I'll then:
- Read the relevant files from the repo
- Understand the code structure
- Create accurate module content
- Include real code examples
- Link to actual files in the repo
